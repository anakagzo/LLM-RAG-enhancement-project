**ABOUT US**

- **WHO ARE WE?**

YesLove! is a company that leverages technology to promote healthy intimate relationships from a mental health perspective. We achieve this by offering guidance on love and mental health, whilst collaborating with mental health professionals to deliver and enhance culturally-sensitive care through artificial intelligence (AI) and other innovative methods. We also provide safe, non-judgmental community spaces that cater to our target audience both online and offline. Our organisation serves individuals navigating relationship challenges, as well as organisations seeking to support members who are at risk of, have experienced, or are experiencing intimate relationship difficulties—including divorce—enabling them to lead fulfilling lives and contribute positively to society.

- **OUR STORY**

In today’s fast-paced world, where love is often entangled with complexity, a story of resilience and innovation emerged, led by Jael Kayumbi. Inspired by her own challenges, Jael turned personal adversity into a mission of healing, understanding, and transformation.

At a pivotal moment in her life, as she navigated the emotional challenges of her relationship, Jael encountered the often-overlooked intersection of love and mental health. Where others saw only hurdles, she recognised an opportunity to reimagine how couples can nurture and strengthen their emotional connections.

This vision gave birth to YesLove!—not through a calculated business strategy but through Jael’s lived experience and commitment to helping others. Love, to her, is not just romance but also compassion, understanding, and growth. With technology as her tool and mental health as her foundation, she envisioned a platform that would revolutionise relationship support.

YesLove! is more than a platform—it’s a digital haven where artificial intelligence meets human empathy. It’s a space where cultural sensitivity is not just a value but a guiding principle, creating personalised, inclusive support for every relationship.

To bring this vision to life, Jael collaborated with mental health professionals and a dedicated team of changemakers, including Achaillet Badigra, Charles Jackson, and Abdelrhman Rayis. Supported by volunteers from Staffordshire and Keele Universities, they built a resource that provides a lifeline for couples facing the complexities of modern relationships.

YesLove! offers a holistic blend of online communities and offline resources, supporting individuals at every stage—whether navigating conflict, contemplating separation, or simply seeking to enrich their connection. This is a space of non-judgement, understanding, and empowerment.

YesLove! is more than technology; it’s technology with a purpose—a heartfelt message to every user: You are not alone.
